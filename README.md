## Introduction
This repository includes the implementation of skin lesion segmentation on the **ISIC-2018** and **PH2** datasets, as introduced in the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01405.

## Contributions
- Introducing a lightweight hybrid segmentation model that combines the strengths of both Mamba and CNN architectures, effectively leveraging their advantages to enhance performance while keeping computational costs reasonable.
- Building a novel sub-structure called P-Mamba was established and implemented to efficiently learn features of different levels.
